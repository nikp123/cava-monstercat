## cava-monstercat

# This is a config file for [my fork](https://github.com/nikp123/cava) of the [CAVA visualizer](https://github.com/karlstav/cava) (I call it CAVA-GUI)
that makes the visualizer to look like monstercat's. This however isn't a 1:1 recreation.

What is cava
------------

CAVA (or specifically CAVA-GUI) is a real-time audio visualizer for Linux platforms, could be ported to other platforms later
Originally developed by [karlstav](https://github.com/karlstav) and contributors, my fork just adds the ability to be shown as a standalone window instead of the console

Screenshots
-----------

Here are a few screenshots to have an idea how does this look like:

NOTE: Those little cut-outs don't appear on the actual visualizer.

How do I make this work
-----------------------

First you'll need to install [CAVA-GUI](https://github.com/nikp123/cava)

After, you've done that, clone this repo and find the folder with the apropriate resolution and copy the file inside of the folder to 
     
     ~/.config/cava/
replacing the original.

Changing options
----------------
If you already changed the config file, you are free to change it further. You can change: bar number, bar size, bar spacing, window placment, window size, color...etc. For additional info go [here](https://github.com/nikp123/cava)

Other
-----
This is not much of a project, but a small help for those who want to make this work on their machines.

Contributions
-------------

I'll try to make more config files in the future but, you're free to make pull requests for your resolutions. I'll be happy to accept them
