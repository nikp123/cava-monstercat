[general]

# This adjust the way bars are shown
# It can be 'waves' (monstercat smoothing is disabled here), 'normal' and 'scientific' (which disables every effect)
mode = normal
 
# Framerate Default: 60. Accepts only non-negative values.
; framerate = 60 

# Sensitivity in  %. If you think the bars are to low/response is to little, try
# increasing this value 200 means double height. Accepts only non-negative values.
sensitivity = 3

# Autosens will attempt to decrease sensitivity if cava peaks. 1 = on, 0 = off
# overshoot allows bars to overshoot (in % of terminal height) without initiating autosens
autosens = 0
overshoot = 50

# The number of bars (0-200). 0 (default) sets it to auto (fill up console).
# width of bars and space between bars in number of characters. Default width 3 and space 1.

## DO NOT USE THESE, THEY ARE ONLY FOR TERMINAL MODES 
; bar_width = 2

# The following options are window options

# This adjusts the window height/width in pixels
window_width = 1600
window_height = 460

# Enables or disables fullscreen mode, but it runs at desktop resolution
window_fullscreen = 0

# Enables or disables window borders
window_border = 0

# Enables or disables window transparency. (aka. the ability for the window to be see-through)
window_transparency = 1

# The following options keep the adjust the window position when CAVA is open

# This fxp. aligns the window to a certain part of the screen
# Valid options are: 'top_left', 'top', 'top_right', 'left', 'center', 'right', 'bottom_left', 'bottom', 'bottom_right'

# Lower and higher cutoff frequencies for lowest and highest bars
# the bandwith of the visualizer, defaults to 50 - 10000 Hz
# Note: there is a minimum total bandwith of 43Mhz x number of bars. 
# Cava will automatically increase the higher cuttoff if a too low band is specified.

[input]

# method of capturing audio, possible methods are: 'pulse', 'alsa' or 'fifo'.
# Defaults to 'pulse', 'alsa' or 'fifo', in that order, dependent on what support cava was built with
#
# All input methods uses the same config variable 'source' 
# to define where it should get the audio.
#
# for pulseaudio 'source' will be the source. Default: 'auto', which uses the monitor source of the default sink
# (all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them)
# 
# for alsa 'source' will be the capture device. Default: 'hw:Loopback,1'
# for fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file. Default: '/tmp/mpd.fifo'

[output]

# The output method is the way you want CAVA to be displayed/shown to you

# Graphical options are: 'sdl' and 'x'
# Other options are: 'raw' (aka. serial output)
method = x

# visual styles, may be 'stereo' or 'mono'. 
# Stereo mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# Mono averages both channels and outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies
style = mono

# raw output target defaults to stdout, a fifo will be created if target does not exist
; raw_target = /dev/stdout

# raw data format, can be binary or ascii
; data_format = binary

# binary bit format, can be '8bit' (0-255) or '16bit' (0-65530) 
; bit_format = 16bit

# ascii max value, in ascii mode range will run from 0 to value specified here
; ascii_max_range = 1000

# use decimal value in ascii table (i.e. 59 = ';' and 10 = '\n' (line feed)) 
; bar_delimiter = 59
; frame_delimiter = 10


[color]

# The background color can be only visible when transparency mode is turned off
# Foreground color is the color of the bars, obviously :P
# supported colors are: red, green, yellow, magenta, cyan, white, blue, black.
# or defined by hex code '#xxxxxx' (hex code must be within '')
background = black
foreground = default


[smoothing]

# multiplier for the integral smoothing calculations. Takes values from 0 - 0.99.
# Higher values means smoother, but less precise. 0 to disable.
integral = 0.9

# disables or enables the so-called "Monstercat smoothing". Default: 1. Set to 0 to disable. Can take decimal values.
monstercat = 0.98

# Set gravity multiplier for "drop off". Higher values means bars will drop faster. 
# Accepts only non-negative values. 0.5 means half gravity, 2 means double. Set to 0 to disable "drop off".
gravity = 2.5

# In bar height, bars that would have been lower that this will not be drawn.
ignore = 0


[eq]

# These are the equalizer options for CAVA.
# You can split bars into different setcions
# Different sections can be adjusted for different results

# These options achieve the best results IMO
